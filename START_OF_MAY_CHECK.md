# Start_Of_May_Check_In
This update is from May 3 (a little less than a month before the project is done)

This is after the one month break for Onshape

## What still need to be done?

### Design/Cut

Until testing, there isn't a ton we can do here, but we possibly will need to change things depending on how it works while testing. It is very possible that a design change will be necessary. We also need to figure out placement and attachment of the pieces. 

### Coding/Wiring

Sadly, the few tasks from the one month still need to be done before we can move onto the testing and refining stages of the project. We had trouble with the pi and it hung us up, but the code is complete. On the coding/wiring side of things, the code working together and without being attached to a computer still needs to be figured out. Making it battery operated and soldering pieces together also needs to be completed within the next few weeks.

### Overall

Overall we still need to test with the weight on the plane
