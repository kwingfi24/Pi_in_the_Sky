Kaitlyn - The Accelerometer and display screen are finished as of today. They will need to be tested and tweaked during the tstin gof different prototypes, but they should work relatively well. I also have started on the camera. I did not get too far with this today. I hope to have it finished by Thursday or mid Tuesday at the latest. There is no school on Monday, but I'm not too worried about losing the day. It was sort of planned for in the schedule.
