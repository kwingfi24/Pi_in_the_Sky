Kaitlyn - The Accelerometer and display screen are finished as of today. They will need to be tested and tweaked during the tstin gof different prototypes, but they should work relatively well. I also have started on the camera. I did not get too far with this today. I hope to have it finished by Thursday or mid Tuesday at the latest. There is no school on Monday, but I'm not too worried about losing the day. It was sort of planned for in the schedule.

Kaitlyn - I got the camera working half way today. I will have to work over the weekend or push it over to Tuesday next week. I got the camera to take pictures consecutively every 10 seconds. This also doesn't start until a button is pressed and has a 2 second delay. The part I am struggling to do is make the pictures stop when the button is pressed again. I found a helpful website that explains a lot about the button import. (the link is https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#button)
