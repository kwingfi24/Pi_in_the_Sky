This is where we will keep tabs on our progress during the duration of this project.

Kaitlyn - The Accelerometer and display screen are finished as of today. They will need to be tested and tweaked during the tstin gof different prototypes, but they should work relatively well. I also have started on the camera. I did not get too far with this today. I hope to have it finished by Thursday or mid Tuesday at the latest. There is no school on Monday, but I'm not too worried about losing the day. It was sort of planned for in the schedule.

Kaitlyn - I got the camera working half way today. I will have to work over the weekend or push it over to Tuesday next week. I got the camera to take pictures consecutively every 10 seconds. This also doesn't start until a button is pressed and has a 2 second delay. The part I am struggling to do is make the pictures stop when the button is pressed again. I found a helpful website that explains a lot about the button import. (the link is https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#button)

Kaitlyn - I tried different methods such as while loops and defining different things. I'm not ablr to figure out how to stop the program after a certain number of pictures or amount of time. There is a way to take a certain amount of photos but there are way too many to keep up with (it takes a certain amount of photos every second rather than minute). I've been stuck with this. I did see that you could take a video for a second then pause for 2 then record again for 1 second and the repeating. I'm thinking I can take this and use it, but instead of a video have it take pictures.

Kaitlyn - My idea from Tuesday worked. I found this code from https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html and it has the pi camera take a picture eafter a certain amount of time (I have it set to every 1 second right now) for a certain amount of time (I have it set for 6 seconds for testing at the moment). The time between each photo and how long it runs for will depend on how long the plane is in the air. It still needs to be a bit worked out, but I'm stepping away to work on another part of the priject.
